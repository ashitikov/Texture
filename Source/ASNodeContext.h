 * - During the call to `nodeForItem:` & related methods for ASCollectionNode or ASTableNode.

/**
 * A node context is an object that is shared by, and uniquely identifies, an "embedding" of nodes. For example,
 * each cell in a collection view has its own context. Each ASViewController's node has its own context. You can
 * also explicitly establish a context for a node tree in another context.
 *
 * Node contexts store the mutex that is shared by all member nodes for synchronization. Operations such as addSubnode:
 * will lock the context's mutex for the duration of the work.
 *
 * Nodes may not be moved from one context to another. For instance, you may not detach a subnode of a cell node,
 * and reattach it to a subtree of another cell node in the same or another collection view.
 *
 * Node contexts are established in the `-initWithContext:` method and do not change. For ease of use, a default
 * context will be used from the `-init` method if available.
